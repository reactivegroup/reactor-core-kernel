/**
 * A simple base class for a {@link Subscriber} implementation that lets the user
 * perform a {@link #request(long)} and {@link #cancel()} on it directly. As the targeted
 * use case is to manually handle requests, the {@link #hookOnSubscribe(Subscription)} and
 * {@link #hookOnNext(Object)} hooks are expected to be implemented, but they nonetheless
 * default to an unbounded request at subscription time. If you need to define a {@link Context}
 * for this {@link BaseSubscriber}, simply override its {@link #currentContext()} method.
 * <p>
 * Override the other optional hooks {@link #hookOnComplete()},
 * {@link #hookOnError(Throwable)} and {@link #hookOnCancel()}
 * to customize the base behavior. You also have a termination hook,
 * {@link #hookFinally(SignalType)}.
 * <p>
 * Most of the time, exceptions triggered inside hooks are propagated to
 * {@link #onError(Throwable)} (unless there is a fatal exception). The class is in the
 * {@code reactor.core.publisher} package, as this subscriber is tied to a single
 * {@link org.reactivestreams.Publisher}.
